# CS 472 Intro to Machine Learning
## Fall 2021
## David Sant Completed Assignments

This repository contains my completions for the CS 472 class. I am going to make
this repository public, but I don't plan to post anything until after the assignments
have been submitted. If you are a student in a future semester and you are hoping
to get help with your own assignments, you are welcome to look at what I have done.
However, keep in mind that you can't copy my code as that would be cheating. Additionally,
my code has not been reviewed by any TA's or instructors for the class, so there
are no guarantees that my code works as I report that it does.

I have tried to add a requirements.txt file for each one of the assignments that
has a special imported package that does not come with the basic installation of
python. I will update documentation as the semester goes on, so hopefully this
is easy to follow.
