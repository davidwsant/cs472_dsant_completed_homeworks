## Perceptron Assignment - Lab 1
### Dave Sant September 2021

This is Dave Sant's submission for the perceptron lab. I did not finish everything to
completion because I am auditing the class and will not receive a grade for this project,
but I have written up a class called Perceptron with all of the functions required and
I have written a test_train_split function that can be used to randomly shuffle and
split datasets with labels. I have put those into a .py file, but I have used
a jupyter notebook to go through the lab and build objects and run the functions.
I have written everything for my "report" in markdown cells in the jupyter notebook.
Note the requirements.txt file. You can use pip install -r requirements.txt or pip
install liac-arff. I liked this better than the scipy arff package.
